      <P>Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, 
      comparable to Perl, Tcl, Scheme, or Java. </P>
      <P>Some of Python's notable features: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        <P>Python uses an elegant syntax for readable programs. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python is an agile language that makes it easy to get your program 
        working. This makes Python an ideal language for prototype development 
        and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising 
        maintainability. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>A variety of basic data types are available: numbers ( floating 
        point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII 
        and Unicode), lists, dictionaries. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple 
        inheritance. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Code can be grouped into modules and packages. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in 
        cleaner error handling. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Data types are strongly but dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible 
        types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception 
        to be raised. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and 
        list comprehensions. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Automatic garbage collection frees you from the hassles of memory 
        management. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The large standard library supports many common programming tasks 
        such as connecting to web servers, regular expressions, and file 
        handling. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of 
        code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The Python interpreter is easily extended by adding new modules 
        implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The interpreter can also be embedded into an application to provide a 
        programmable interface. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python runs on many different computers and operating systems: 
        Windows, MacOS, many brands of Unix, OS/2, ... </P>
        <LI>

      <P>To begin learning the Python language, you should download the Python 
      interpreter (<A

      and read a tutorial (<A
