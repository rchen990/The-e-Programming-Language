<h2 class=intro> Overview </h2>

The <I>e</I> programming language is a new general purpose object-oriented programming language.  

<i>e</i> is both a compiled and a scripting language: e programs can be run as scripts or compiled into binary objects and ran in native machine languages. 

e is efficient, powerful, easy to learn and use. 
e combines many features present in C, Java, Perl, Python and Tcl into one truly versatile language. 

e can be used in places such as web publishing, shell scripting, and application development where rapid programming turnaround is desired. 

<P>
Comparing with the C programing language, e is a high level language, operating on complex data structures such as lists, dictionaries, strings and complex <em>objects</em> defined in e. e offers a straitforwad and effective way of object oriented programming. Comparing with the Python progaming lanugae, e is comletely free form without the curbersome and anoying tab formating restrictions. e offers a rich set of control sturctures and operators comparable to that in C, Perl and Python. e has powerful intrinsic operators that allows direct manipulation of strings and lists. Unlike Perl, e has an elegant syntax, simple and straightforward method of handling modules and external objects. e has internal handling for regular expressions. Unlike perl, e's approach to regular expression is based on simplicity and easy of use.

      <P>Some of e's notable features include: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        <P>e is both a compiled and scripting language. e programs can be run directly as scripts, or entered interactively as in a command shell, or be compiled into native machine code and ran as objects. </P>
	<LI>
        <P>e is completely free form, without the cubersome tab delimited formating restriction of Python. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>e has an elegant style, has a rich set of operators comparable with Perl, Python and Java. e can operates on complex data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and objects. </P>

	<LI>
	<P> e is extensible. extenal objects can be incorporated into e programs seamlessly and with no explicit intervention from the programmer.
 
is an agile language that makes it easy to get your program 
        working. This makes Python an ideal language for prototype development 
        and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising 
        maintainability. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>A variety of basic data types are available: numbers ( floating 
        point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII 
        and Unicode), lists, dictionaries. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple 
        inheritance. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Code can be grouped into modules and packages. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in 
        cleaner error handling. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Data types are strongly but dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible 
        types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception 
        to be raised. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The large standard library supports many common programming tasks 
        such as connecting to web servers, regular expressions, and file 
        handling. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of 
        code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The Python interpreter is easily extended by adding new modules 
        implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>The interpreter can also be embedded into an application to provide a 
        programmable interface. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Python runs on many different computers and operating systems: 
        Windows, MacOS, many brands of Unix, OS/2, ... </P>

<h2 class=intro> Getting e </h2>
      <P>To begin learning the e language, you should download the Python 
      interpreter (<A
